I worked extensively alongside the client, and the final design made liberal use of white space, strong typography and bold splashes of colour to achieve what was expected of the brief.',

I utilised use of space to give a more ambient, spaced out vibe to the logo mark, and the final design incorporates both minimal, memorable design with the DIY aesthetic of the label.',
