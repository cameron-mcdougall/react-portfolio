# react-portfolio
Recreating my old static HTML portfolio with a dynamically generated React portfolio. All portfolio content will be input in to a single JS object array and used to create as many portfolio porject entries as there are array elements.

Further scope down the line will be to add a dashboard login where a portfolio project can be added directly to the JS object array through a web based interface, rather than pulling the JS file directly.
